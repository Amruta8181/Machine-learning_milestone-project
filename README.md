# Machine-learning_milestone-project
This project aims to predict whether a loan will be approved or not using machine learning. The goal is to make the loan approval process faster and more accurate.

Project Overview:
We use a real-world dataset to predict loan approval decisions based on details like income, employment, and assets. By applying machine learning methods, we aim to support a smoother and more reliable approval process.

**overall process:**
**Goal:** Predict loan approval using machine learning to automate and improve decision-making.

**Dataset:** Real-world loan data with demographic, financial, and asset information.

**Data Prep:**

Cleaned and encoded data; handled missing values.

Transformed income (log scale) and label encoded key categorical features.

**Model**:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.

**Insights:**

High prediction accuracy achieved.

Applicant income, CIBIL score, and assets are top predictors.

**Impact:** Enables faster, more accurate, and consistent loan approval decisions.
